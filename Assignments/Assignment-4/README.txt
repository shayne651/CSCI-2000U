Creating the CVS file
-To create the CVS file I coppied the needed collums into a new spreadsheet using LibreOffice Calc, from there I saved the file as a CVS. After this was done i opened the file in notepad and used the ctrl F shortcut to find all spaces, "", Â°, and commas when I found them I would delete them so that it can be made into a float later
